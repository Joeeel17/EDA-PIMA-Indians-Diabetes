# Exploratory Data Analysis w/ PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset 
Dataset : (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

# Description
Main objective was to train self in Exploratory Data Analysis. Hence, project will be entirely focused on investigating and analyzing the dataset through a plethora of exploratory data analysis  techniques to determine top five variables that are most significant to the application of predicting whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Aside from that,  the secondary aim is to generate and reveal possible hypotheis through analyzing the relationship between the variables. Another would be to conduct and familiarize with simple clustering analysis to predict patients that have diabetes or not.
